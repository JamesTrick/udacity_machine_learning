# Background to Enron Scandal

Enron used to be the 7th largest corporation in the United States (US). However, in the late 90s
Enron started to experience losses. Instead of reportig these loses, Enron used creative accounting
to effectively hide the true financial performance and position of the company. In 2001, Enron filed
for bankruptcy.

The Enron scandal was one of the first major case of corporate mis-management.

## Using machine learning to identify Who's who

The goal of this project and repo is identify persons of interest in the Enron Scandal. To do this,
we're going to use Machine Learning techniques implemented in Python. Machine learning is a natural
fit for a goal like this as we have large amounts of data, and manually reading, labelling, classifying
the data would be prohibetively expensie in terms of labour costs.
